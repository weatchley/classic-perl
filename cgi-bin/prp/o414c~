The CRD includes activity-specific requirements for work that also may need to comply with QA regulations.  This integration requirement supplements but does not supersede or alter compliance with QA regulations.  Where a work activity, process, or item is specifically identified as within the scope of a QA regulation (e.g., 10 CFR 830 or 10 CFR 63), that regulation prevails.  In the event of a conflict between this CRD and any QA regulation, the regulation prevails.   [See QAP integration requirement, paragraph 2a(4) below.]

sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.	Corrective Action Effectiveness Review.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(1)	Purpose.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(1)(a)	Evaluation of findings and implementation of corrective actions is conducted to correct the underlying causes for the finding.  In some instances completed corrective actions have failed to effectively resolve or prevent recurrence of the same or similar assessment findings.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(1)(b)	Effectiveness reviews will -
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(1)(b)1	determine whether completed corrective actions have or have not effectively resolved and prevented recurrence of the same or similar findings at the performance level;
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(1)(b)2	identify additional actions necessary to effectively resolve the findings and prevent recurrence; and
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(1)(b)3	collect effectiveness data for subsequent analyses and sharing of lessons learned.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)	Conduct of Effectiveness Reviews.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(a)	Upon completion of the corrective actions, the FEM must initiate a follow-up review of the completed corrective actions to verify they are closed, ensure all findings were effectively resolved, and ensure the same or similar findings will not recur.   A formal review report approved by the FEM must be completed within 6 months after the CAP completion date (the date when all corrective actions for all findings listed in the CAP have been completed). NOTE:  This requirement is effective on the approval date of this  Order for all CAPs that have not been approved but are not been approved, CAPs that have been approved but are not complete (all corrective actions in the CAP are not complete and there is not a CAP completion date), and all future CAPs.  The FEM will determine -
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(a)1	how the review is conducted,
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(a)2	who conducts the review,
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(a)3	what specific completed corrective actions are reviewed for each finding,
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(a)4	when the review is initiated, and
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(a)5	how the review report will be formatted.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(b)	Other sites/organizations that tracked and provided updates of their responsible corrective actions to completion and verification must coordinate effectiveness review activities with the lead FEM for consolidation and submission.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(c)	For each finding, the FEM will select for review a sufficient number of completed corrective actions to allow an objective, accurate assessment of effectiveness in resolving the finding and preventing recurrence.  Standards for conducting effectiveness reviews include the following.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(c)1	A 100 percent review of all corrective actions is not required to determine effectiveness.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(c)2	Effectiveness reviews can be initiated at any time during CAP implementation.
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(c)3	Reviews are initiated based on -
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(c)3a	severity of a finding,
sourcerequirement_id_seq.next	58	Attachment 4; 2.d.(2)(c)3b	length of time needed to review selected corrective actions,
